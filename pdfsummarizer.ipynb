As might be clear, untreated sewage is the greatest wellspring of such type of contamination in India. There are different wellsprings of contamination, for example, overflow from the rural division just as unregulated units that have a place with the little scale industry. The circumstance is serious to the point that maybe there is no water body in India that isn\\'t contaminated to some degree or the other. Truth be told, it is said that practically 80% of the waterbodies in India are exceptionally dirtied. This is particularly material of ones that some structure or the other of human residence in their quick region. Ganga and Yamuna are the most dirtied waterways in India.\\nThe single main motivation for water contamination in India is urbanization at an uncontrolled rate. The rate of urbanization has just gone up at a quick pace in the most recent decade or somewhere in the vicinity, however and still, at the end of the day it has left a permanent imprint on India\\'s sea-going assets. This has prompted a few ecological issues in the long haul like scarcity in water supply, age and accumulation of wastewater to give some examples. The treatment and transfer of wastewater has likewise been a noteworthy issue in such manner. The zones close waterways have seen a lot of towns and urban areas come up and this has likewise added to the developing force of issues. \\nUncontrolled urbanization in these territories has additionally prompted age of sewage water. In the urban regions water is utilized for both modern and local purposes from waterbodies, for example, waterways, lakes, streams, wells, and lakes. Most exceedingly bad still, 80% of the water that we use for our household reasons for existing is passed out as wastewater. In a large portion of the cases, this water isn\\'t dealt with appropriately and all things considered it prompts colossal contamination of surface-level freshwater. This dirtied water additionally leaks through the surface and toxic substances groundwater. It is evaluated that urban communities with populaces of more than one lakh individuals produce around 16,662 million liters of wastewater in multi day. For some odd reason, 70% of the general population in these urban communities approach sewerage offices. Urban areas and towns situated on the banks of Ganga create around 33% of wastewater produced in the nation.\\nThe Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in relationship with State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees(PPCs) is observing the nature of water bodies at 2500 areas the nation over under National Water Quality Monitoring Program (NWQMP) which demonstrate that natural contamination is the overwhelming reason for water contamination. In view of the size of natural contamination, CPCB in 2008 recognized 150 dirtied stream extends which expanded to 302 of every 2015. The waterways extends are dirtied fundamentally because of release of untreated/in part treated sewage and release of modern wastewater. CPCB surveyed the all out volume of civil wastewater age in the nation at around 61,948 MLD as against the introduced sewage treatment limit of 23,277 MLD leaving a wide hole of more than 38,671 MLD.Similar perceptions were made by WHO in its reports on water contamination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. LITERATURE SURVEY:\\n\\nThis work represents the implementation of the two well-known power efficient data gathering and aggregation protocols: PEDAP and PEDAP-PA. Simulations are used to show that both the algorithms perform near optimal.  The simulations show that keeping all the nodes to work together is important. PEDAP-PA performs best among others but where the lifetime of the last node is important, PEDAP is a good alternative. [1]\\n\\n\\nThis paper introduces us a MAC and cross-layer routing approach to QoS assessment in a WSN. The investigation is primarily based on two methods: the best-effort and latency constraint. These approaches can be used for rapid assessment of expected quality of service in the networks as well as finding of time division multiplexing schedules for utilization in network. The final simulation that is done shows that reliability in substantial gain is achieved. [2]\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this paper, data-centric routing is statistically assessed and its performance is compared with traditional end to end routing schemes. The impact of source to destination placement and network density on the energy costs is carefully examined in this paper. The significance of data-centric routing that offers high performance across variety of range of operational scenarios. [3]\\n\\n\\n\\nThis paper compares the various algorithms that make predictions in time series by data mined from WSN. A simulation is performed that shows the nature of the data and their entropy deeply influences the performance of the selected algorithm. After the implementation and observation of results, it is concluded that gradually changing data is best for ARMA, and for data with sharp changes, MA is the most suitable. [4] \\n           \\nIn this paper, a novel technique, DBP, is applied to over 13 million data points from four real world applications. The assessment shows that the technique vanquishes 99 percent of the application data and its performance is often better than the other common approaches. [5]\\n\\nHuge reductions in communication is hence automatically allowed in this technique. Practical use of DBP includes improving system lifetime from every aspect. The paper is very well explained and the important terms are beautifully highlighted in detail.[6] \\n\\n\\nGrouping the sensors into clusters is very well explained in this paper. The technique used here is heterogeneous clustering, which is very energy-efficient. This is done by selecting the cluster head from the cluster with respect to the residual energy of the nodes, transmission range and number of transmissions. The connectivity, considered as a measure of QoS, is ensured by Route identification technique. [7]\\n\\n\\nThis paper analyses the wireless sensor networks that are very important in distributed-based systems. The paper models and analyses the performance value of data aggregation in the network in question. The results show that what ever the sources of cluster, either clustered or randomly, energy gains can happen with data aggregation. The energy gain is maximum when the number of sources is large and are located relatively close to each other. [8]\\n\\n\\nThis paper analyses the three main phases of fault tolerance and fault detection models at four level of abstractions, namely, hardware, system software, middleware and applications. Four scopes, namely, components of individual node, individual node, network and the distributed system also encloses the fault model that is being analysed. \\nA final conclusion is made that a brief survey of the future directions can widely affect the tolerance research in wireless sensor networks. [9]\\n\\n\\n\\nThis paper gives an analysis that defines the fault tolerance and the various terms related to it. Various aspects of data constraints such as redundancy and touched-upon fault tolerance has been explored and explained that are used in Wireless Sensor networks. Some of the techniques that has been covered in this paper are redundancy in hardware, NMR and N-version programming software. [10]\\n\\nThis paper describes the optimization problems that deal with wireless networks, its planning and design. Deployment and operation that give rise to formulation for multi-objective optimisation formulations. A list of constraints in the paper is also listed beautifully to give a reference of various constraints that has been taken into account while calculating the optimisation problems. This paper aims at opening up new research avenues in the path of wireless network optimisation. \\nThe concern of this paper is data, topology and hierarchy. It examines the different types of wireless routing protocols, research done in this field as well as classifies the various methods that are said. It also helps one to know whether optimization of traffic and energy is done. Other benefits include knowing the node mobility, where the node is deployed etc [11].\\n\\n In this paper, wireless sensor networks are classified based on their network type that is either proactive or reactive. Also, a protocol called TEEN (Threshold sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network protocol) is introduced and used primarily for energy efficiency and applications with time constraints and performance is measured. It outruns the conventional sensor network protocols [12].\\n\\nThe main concern of this paper is providing security for routing sensors. It is more of an analysis of various types of sensor attacks such as sinkholes, etc. The scrutiny of all major routing protocols is studied. Apart from investigation, model design and counteractions are also discussed. They have proved that current technologies are insecure and propose for the development of a system that is much better than the standard cryptographic techniques [13]. \\n\\nThis paper proposes a cluster model called the LEACH (Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) protocol that works in a distributive environment. This is vital for reducing the energy usage by distributing the energy evenly to all the sensors. This provides large scale usability as well as toughness. There is also evidence of decrease in communication energy and lifespan [14].\\n\\nThis paper primarily focusses on energy efficiency of untended sensors or actuators. An algorithm, termed as GEAR also known as geographic and energy aware routing is introduced. Routing is decided based on the neighbour’s selection. This also avoids the typical flooding scenario. Simulation is done to measure the performance. In terms of packet, it outperforms GPSR by 70 to 80% and also packets delivered are 25 to 30% more than a GPSR. Current work includes developing a working prototype of GEAR protocol [15]. \\n\\nThe main objective of this paper is to create a hybrid protocol called APTEEN which primarily focusses on retrieval of information, reacting to periodic as well as time critical events. It enables a user to get the historical data in the form of queries and analyse it. This model works better in terms of energy efficiency as well as the lifetime of senor networks whose nodes are evenly distributed and could be extended to unevenly distributed nodes in the future [16].\\n\\nThis paper emphases on need for energy efficient wireless sensors because there is battery oriented and it’s hard to track and replace them. Routing protocol called the Base-Station Controlled Dynamic Clustering Protocol (BCDCP) is introduced that aims in even distribution of energy among the sensor nodes and compares it to LEACH-C and PEGASIS.BCDCP provide a means of balancing the clusters as well as outperforming the computational tasks that demands more energy and provides a wide range of applicability for sensors [17]. \\nThis paper is a study of energy efficient routing for wireless sensors. It investigates the energy histogram and draws various methods to enhance routing. Packet streams are joined together in the first approach, next arguments on various energy efficient routing of sensors is done. Finally, conclusions are drawn that energy efficient routing is impossible in practical life. This paper stresses more on the need of practical implementations of energy efficient routing models [18].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.METHODOLOGY:\\n\\nSystem architecture: -\\nThe key research questions in methods development are driven by the various monitoring needs tied to compliance with the national water quality standards, real time public information, and support for atmospheric and health research studies. The main aim is to design, develop and implement a mechanism to identify various contamination issues and assess the level of pollution in relation to the water quality standards as defined by Indian government. Analysing effluent data values with the predefined thresholds as stated by CPCB and generating alert information depending on the degree of pollution.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            \\n                                          Figure 1: water quality system architecture\\n\\n \\nFunctional modules\\nSensors data Aggregation\\nGateway functionality\\nServer analysis (ML, Decision making)\\nNetwork failure optimization \\n\\nWe acquired the dataset with various columns of sensor data from various places in India. we have the average readings of ambient air quality with respect to air quality parameters are collected from PH sensor, NITRATENAN N+ NITRITENANN\\xa0Sensor, FECAL COLIFORM\\xa0Sensor, B.O.D.\\xa0Sensor, D.O.\\xa0Sensor, TEMPERATURE Sensor. Data acquired from the source has noisier data since few of the data from the stations have been shifted or closed the period were marked as NAN or not available.so we have to pre-process the data in order to remove the outliers.\\n\\nSample dataset: -\\n\\n                                             Table 1: Water Quality Data\\n  \\nIn this dataset we have the pollutant concentration levels occurring on each place. These parameters should be reduced show that our model learning and predicting rate will be better. So, we have calculated the water quality index (WQI) for all the available data points.to calculate the WQI we have to find the individual indexes of each pollutant. Each index of pollutant represents the level of damage caused by the pollutant. Each indexes which varies with its own scale.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.WATER DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nFrom the obtained dataset, various from pollutant concentrations are obtained from PH sensor, NITRATENAN N+ NITRITENANN Sensor, FECAL COLIFORM Sensor, B.O.D.

These graphs have no increasing or decreasing trends on their measure. So various data cleaning techniques will be used to clean the data.\\n\\n\\n\\nOutlier analysis: -\\n In this problem there are various outlier on the pollution concentration from various sensor readings, so box plot outlier analysis is used to identify and remove the outliers from the Dataframe. The box plot consist of various quartiles Q1,Q2,Q3. Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartile and Q2 is the median in the Dataframe. After the Q1 region the points are called smallest non outlier and Q3 region has largest outlier.\\n                             \\n                                   Figure 14: Box plot analysis\\nThe datapoints which are away from the Q1 and Q3 regions are classified as outlier from the Dataframe. These outliers should be removed so the data will be cleaned, and various machine learning algorithms can be applied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Figure 15: Boxplot analysis for PH values\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Figure 16:Boxplot analysis for B.O.D\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Figure 17:Boxplot analysis for D.O\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                 Figure 18: Boxplot analysis for NITRATE                          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCorrelation matrix of features:\\n\\n Correlation matrix is generated for the Dataframe to identify the dependency or relationship between the features. Various features like do, ph, co, bod, na, tc data values are taken and correlation matrix is generated.  This also helps in feature selection of the choosen dataframe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 19: Correlation matrix of water quality data \\n\\n Generated the heat maps for the correlation matrix to identify the level of dependency and relationship among the features.\\n\\n\\n      Figure 20:Heat maps of Correlation matrix\\n\\n\\n\\nCalculating water quality index (WQI): -\\nWater quality index (WQI) is valuable and unique rating to depict the overall water quality status in a single term that is helpful for the selection of appropriate treatment technique to meet the concerned issues. However, WQI depicts the composite influence of different water quality parameters and communicates water quality information to the public and legislative decision makers. In spite of absence of a globally accepted composite index of water quality.\\nThe water quality index of a particular data point is the aggregate of maximum indexed pollutant on that particular area. That pollutants max sub index is taken as the air quality index of that particular location. This maximum value of the pollutants is taken as water quality index because to backtrack the pollutant levels from the water quality index.\\n\\n\\n                                                       Table 3: WQI range\\nThis method for comparing the water quality of various water sources is based upon nine water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, turbidity, feral coliform, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphates, nitrates and total solids.

It is named as logistic regression since it uses logit function to classify.\\nIn classification problems, input variables are continuous  and the outputs are in categorical form.\\nSimple logistic regression models use sigmoid function.standard logistic function is as follows.it takes values from 0 and 1.\\n\\nHere t is a linear function \\n\\n\\nModel\\n\\nFigure 26: Here t is considered as a linear function.0 stands for negative and 1 stands for positive class\\n\\n\\n\\nApplying this to our model it will become \\n\\nAnd one of the advantage of using logistic regression is that it will take care of the outliers.\\n\\nLOGISTIC REGRESSION TYPES:\\n\\tBINARY\\n\\tMULTI CLASS\\n\\tORDINAL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBINARY –\\nHere we have two output classes 0 and 1.email,fraudent,tumor problems comes into this category.\\n1)SIGMOIDFUNCTION\\nHere s(z) represents the output that varies from 0 to 1\\ne is the natural logarithm base\\nz is the input function\\n\\n\\nFigure 27: sigmoid function graph\\n\\nIt typically ranges from 0 to 1 and has\\n1)step function that is non linear in nature.\\n2)change in value of x influences the value of y .\\n3)they are simple since output is between 0 and 1.\\nThey can result in vanishing gradient problem since there is no learning at the end and also they are not zero centric.\\nThey are preferred less now a days but work well with classification problems especially binary ones.\\n\\nDecision boundary\\nA score between 0 and 1 is given as output using the current function(0/1 class),here we use a tipping point to classify them into the relevant classes. They can be linear or non linear in nature.\\n\\nFigure 28: graph showing the decision boundaries\\n\\nDecision boundary can be considered similar to threshold. For example ,consider a decision boundary around 0.5,if there is a prediction of value 0.2 it will belong to class 0 or if its above 0.5 ,then to class 1.\\nTo predict complex problems degree of the polynomial can be increased.\\n\\nFigure 29: non linear decision boundary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCost function-\\nThe linear regression cost function does not work well here.we will end up with a non convex function by doing so.\\n\\n                       Figure 30: various local minima’s in the same problem\\n\\nHere it is difficult to find the local minima.this is due to the presence of non linear sigmoid function.there are chances of getting struck at these points also termed as local minima and leading to poor performance.\\n\\n\\n\\nSimplified cost function\\nSo we need a better function for logistic regresssion due to problem stated above.\\n\\nThis is known as cross entropy.it seperates the cost function into two –one for class 0 and other for class 1.it helps in finding minimum cost easily \\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 31: Representation of class 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 32: Representation of class 0 \\n\\nCombined cost function is as follows.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf y equals 1,second part after addition cancels out and if its zero the first part will become zero and provides better metrics.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGradient descent:\\n\\nIt is an optimization algorithm used for classical problems.In real life scenario ,take an example where your at the mountain top and you want to proceed to the lake at the lowest point of the mountain.the best route is to look outside and check the path that descends down and advance.\\n\\nFigure 33: representation of gradient decent \\n\\nThis is used to find the best parameters for our algorithm. They are generally classified as \\n1)full batch\\n2)stochastic\\nBased on techniques for differentiation they are classified as \\n1)first order\\n2)second order\\n\\n                      Figure 34: issues in gradient descent \\nThere are various issues with the gradient descent that include\\n1) Data and input issues\\n2) Gradient issues\\n3) Deployment issues\\n\\nDATA ISSUES\\n\\tNon convex optimization problems can be inferred due to the way the data is arranged leading to local minima constriants.it works well with problems that have convex optimization problem.\\n\\tAnother issue is saddle point where the gradient becomes zero but it is not the optimal point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nISSUES WITH GRADIENT\\n\\nFigure 35: vanishing gradient problem\\nThere is a possibility of vanishing gradient and exploding gradient problems and the model will not converge well.\\n\\nDEPLOYMENT ISSUES\\nHow well resources are used by networks must also be taken care .\\n\\nGRADIENT DESCENT\\nIt is an optimization algorithm that minimizes the cost function by choosing the values of parameters correctly.it is used when we cannot calculate parameters manually or when it is computationally expensive.\\nValues for coefficients are picked ,cost function is computed then new coefficients are estimated.\\nRepeating the method for a few times will lead to choosing the best values for parameters and reducing the cost function.\\n\\nPROCEDURE\\nInitial values for the parameters are chosen they can be 0 or very small values.\\nThey are then put into a function and cost of coeffients is computed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe calculus derivation is also computed for a functions slope at a particular point.we need to estimate the direction in which the slope moves .it should move downhill.this is done until the problem is optimized.\\n\\nSTOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT\\nGradient descent becomes slower when the dataset becomes larger.because in each iteration,one instance is predictied and we will have millions of data that are present.in such situations we can use this type of gradient descent.\\n\\n                             Figure 36: choosing gradient descent type\\nfor each instance of training set, we update the coefficents.at each instance the weight are updated and this will result in more noise.it can result in getting stuck at any point and is not optimal ,so we move on to the next type.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBATCH GRADIENT DESCENT\\n\\n\\tSupervised algorithms maps the input variable to the output function.there are different algorithms and representations that are present,but requires different optimization techniques.the cost function is  evaluated for all the outputs and calculates the sum of average.it is implemented for the entire dataset and is the commonly used gradient.\\n\\n                        Figure 37: comparison of various gradient descent\\n\\n\\nVARIANTS OF GRADIENT DESCENT\\nVANNILA GRADIENT\\n\\nIt is a simple model and is pure and no adulteration takes place.updation of parameters is taken care.\\n\\n\\nLearning rate is then multiplied which represents a hyper parameter\\n\\n                      Figure 38: comparison of learning rate\\nGRADIENT DESCENT WITH MOMENTUM\\n\\t\\n\\nIt is same as the previous one except they include a term called velocity that considers the momentum which is aconstant.\\n\\n\\nFigure 39: gradient step representation\\n\\nADAGRAD\\nLearning rate is updated using a technique that is adaptive.it depends upon the iterations .based on previous iterations the learning rate is changed.\\nPseudo code is as follows\\nEpsilon keeps a check on learning rate change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nADAM \\nIt combines momentum and adagrad.\\n\\n\\nAPPLICATION OF GRADIENT DESCENT IN VARIOUS CASES\\n1)Used adam/adagrad in prototyping,we can get the results faster and there is no complexity involved.hyperparameters need not be used in this case.\\n\\n2)by using vanilla descent or momentum it is possible to obtain the best results than using normal gradient descent since it is adoptive technique.\\n\\n3)if the data size is very low ,second order techniques can be implemented.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso the following should be checked.they include\\n1)error rates\\nWe must check them regularly and see if they do down and does not lead to overfitting or underfitting problem\\n2)gradient flow\\nThey should not result in vanishing or exploding descent problem\\n3)learning rate\\nThey are very important for our model to perform and learn better\\n\\n\\nAfter removing the outlier’s linear regression is applied to the filtered data and to fit the trent line on the data points gradient descent hyper parameters are used to optimize the model. We set random values to our slope equation and change according to the learning rate and position of data points.\\n\\n\\nApplying Logistic regression with Gradient decent: -\\n(y=mx+c)\\ny = B1 + B2 * x\\nB1 = 0.0\\nB2 = 0.0\\ny = 0.0 + 0.0 * x\\nerror = p(j) – y(j)\\nx=1, y=1\\np(j) = 0.0 + 0.0 * 1\\np(j) = 0:\\n\\nwe calculated the error by: -\\nerror = 0 – 1\\nerror = -1\\nWe can now use this error rate in our equation for gradient descent to update the its weights. Then we will start with updating the solpe intercept first.\\n\\nB1(t+1) = B2(t) – alpha * error mean\\nB1(t+1) = B2(t) – alpha * error mean * x\\n\\nB2(t+1) = 0.0 – 0.01 * -1 * 1\\nB2(t+1) = 0.01\\n\\nWe have just finished the first iteration of gradient descent and we have updated our weights to be B1=0.01 and B2=0.01. This process must be repeated for the remaining ‘x’ number of instances from our dataset.

redundancy and touched-upon fault tolerance has been explored and explained that are used in Wireless Sensor networks.\\nThis paper describes the optimization problems that deal with wireless

optimisation problems.\\nIt examines the different types of wireless routing protocols, research done in this field as well as classifies the various methods that are said.\\nIn this paper, wireless sensor networks are classified based on their network type that is either proactive or reactive.\\nAlso, a protocol called TEEN (Threshold sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network protocol) is introduced and used primarily for energy efficiency and applications with time constraints and performance is measured.\\nThe main concern of this paper is providing security for routing sensors.\\nThis paper proposes a cluster model called the LEACH (Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy) protocol that works in a distributive environment.\\nThis model works better in terms of energy efficiency as well as the lifetime of senor networks whose nodes are evenly distributed and could be extended to unevenly distributed nodes in the future [16].\\nThis paper emphases on need for energy efficient wireless sensors because there is battery oriented and it’s hard to track and replace them.\\nRouting protocol called the Base-Station Controlled Dynamic Clustering Protocol (BCDCP) is introduced that aims in even distribution of energy among the sensor nodes and compares it to LEACH-C and PEGASIS.BCDCP provide a means of balancing the clusters as well as outperforming the computational tasks that demands more energy and provides a wide range of applicability for sensors [17].\\nThis paper is a study of energy efficient routing for wireless sensors.\\nThis paper stresses more on the need of practical implementations of energy efficient routing models [18].\\nThe main aim is to design, develop and implement a mechanism to identify various contamination issues

quality Dataframe \\nTable 2: Water quality Dataframe \\nIn this problem there are various outlier on the pollution concentration from various sensor readings, so box plot outlier analysis is used to identify and remove the outliers from the Dataframe.\\nThese outliers should be removed so the data will be cleaned, and various machine learning algorithms can be applied.\\nVarious features like do,

research.Recently they are implemented for  categorical problems .\\nFigure 24: non-linear graph\\nFigure 24: non-linear graph\\nLINEAR VS LOGISTIC REGRESSION\\n1) In case of linear regression, we must fix an threshold for classification kind of problem since it is designed to predict continuous value .so linear regression cannot be used for this problem.\\n2)unbounded nature of linear regression makes it hard for classification problems while in logistic regression they vary from 0 to 1.\\nFigure 25:  logistic regression for classification\\nFigure 25:  logistic regression for classification\\nHence logistic regression are preferred for classification problems.\\nIt is named as logistic regression since it uses logit function to classify.\\nIn classification problems, input variables are continuous  and the outputs are in categorical form.\\nSimple logistic regression models use sigmoid function.standard logistic function is as follows.it takes values from 0 and 1.\\nHere t is a linear function \\nFigure 26: Here t is considered as a linear function.0 stands for negative and 1 stands for positive class\\nFigure 26: Here t is considered as a linear function.0 stands for negative and 1 stands for positive class\\nLOGISTIC REGRESSION TYPES:\\nFigure 27: sigmoid function graph\\nFigure 27: sigmoid function graph\\n1)step function that is non linear in nature.\\nThey can result in vanishing gradient problem since there is no learning at the end and also they are not zero centric.\\nThey are preferred less now a days but work well with classification problems especially binary ones.\\nA score between 0 and 1 is given as output using the current function(0/1 class),here we use a tipping point to classify them into the relevant classes.\\nFigure 28: graph showing the decision boundaries\\nFigure 28: graph showing the decision boundaries\\nFor example ,consider a decision boundary around 0.5,if there is a prediction of value 0.2 it will belong to class 0 or if its above 0.5 ,then to class 1.\\nTo predict complex problems degree of the polynomial can be increased.\\nFigure 29: non linear decision boundary\\nFigure 29: non linear decision boundary\\nThe linear regression cost function does not work well here.we will end up with a non convex function by doing so.\\nFigure 30: various local minima’s in the same problem\\nFigure 30: various local minima’s in the same problem\\nHere it is difficult to find the local minima.this is due to the presence of non linear sigmoid function.there are chances of getting struck at these points also termed as local minima and leading to poor performance.\\nSo we need a better function for logistic regresssion due to problem stated above.\\nFigure 32: Representation of class 0 \\nCombined cost function is as follows.\\nIt is an optimization algorithm used for classical problems.In real life scenario ,take an example where your at the mountain top and you want to proceed to the lake at the lowest point of the mountain.the best route is to look outside and check the path that descends down and advance.\\nFigure 33: representation of gradient decent \\nFigure 34: issues in gradient descent \\nFigure 34: issues in gradient descent \\nThere are various issues with the gradient descent that include\\n1) Data and input issues\\nDATA ISSUES\\nAnother issue is saddle point where the gradient becomes zero but it is not the optimal point.\\nISSUES WITH GRADIENT\\nISSUES WITH GRADIENT\\nFigure 35: vanishing gradient problem\\nFigure 35: vanishing gradient problem\\nGRADIENT DESCENT\\nGRADIENT DESCENT\\nIt is an optimization algorithm that minimizes the cost function by choosing the values of parameters correctly.it is used when we cannot calculate parameters manually or when it is computationally expensive.\\nValues for coefficients are picked ,cost function is computed then new coefficients are estimated.\\nRepeating the method for a few times will lead to choosing the best values for parameters and reducing the cost function.\\nThe calculus derivation is also computed for a functions slope at a particular point.we need to estimate the direction in which the slope moves .it should move downhill.this is done until the problem is optimized.\\nSTOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT\\nGradient descent becomes slower when the dataset becomes larger.because in each iteration,one instance is predictied and we will have millions of data that are present.in such situations we can use this type of gradient descent.\\nFigure 36: choosing gradient descent type\\nFigure 36: choosing gradient descent type\\nBATCH GRADIENT DESCENT\\nSupervised algorithms maps the input variable to the output function.there are different algorithms and representations that are present,but requires different optimization techniques.the cost function is  evaluated for all the outputs and calculates the sum of average.it is implemented for the entire dataset and is the commonly used gradient.\\nFigure 37: comparison of various gradient descent\\nFigure 37: comparison of various gradient descent\\nVARIANTS OF GRADIENT DESCENT\\nIt is a simple model and is pure and no adulteration takes place.updation of parameters is taken care.\\nLearning rate is then multiplied which represents a hyper parameter\\nFigure 38: comparison of learning rate\\nFigure 38: comparison of learning rate\\nGRADIENT DESCENT WITH MOMENTUM\\nFigure 39: gradient step representation\\nFigure 39: gradient step representation\\nAPPLICATION OF GRADIENT DESCENT IN VARIOUS CASES\\n2)by using vanilla descent or momentum it is possible to obtain the best results than using normal gradient descent since it is adoptive technique.\\n3)if the data size is very low ,second order techniques can be implemented.\\nThey should not result in vanishing or exploding descent problem\\nThey are very important for our model to perform and learn better\\nAfter removing the outlier’s linear regression is applied to the filtered data and to fit the trent line on the data points gradient descent hyper parameters are used to optimize the model.\\nWe set random values to our slope equation and change according to the learning rate and position of data points.\\nApplying Logistic regression with Gradient decent: -\\nWe can now use this error rate in our equation for gradient descent to update the its weights.\\nWe have just finished the first iteration of gradient descent and we have updated our weights to be B1=0.01 and B2=0.01.\\nFigure 40: Plotting the cost function\\nFigure 40: Plotting the cost function\\nGradient descent for desired features:\\nConverting out input data points into smaller values, to reduce the complexity of the algorithm.\\nFigure
